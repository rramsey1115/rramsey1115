📖 I am currently a student at Nashville Software School studying full stack software development with C#/.NET as my server side focus.

🧑🏻‍💻 Please check out my projects and let me know what you think or if you would be interested in working together!

👀 I’m interested in creating applications which are user friendly, impactful, and which allow me to be creative.

🌱 I’m currently learning to create full-stack applications using React in combination with C#/.NET
